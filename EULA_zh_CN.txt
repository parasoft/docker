6.0 INDEMNIFICATION
6.1 Infringement.  Parasoft shall defend any claim against You that the Software infringes any intellectual property right of a third party, provided that the third party is located in a country that is a signatory to the Berne Convention, and shall indemnify You against any and all damages finally awarded against You by a court of final appeal, or agreed to in settlement by Parasoft and attributable to such claim, so long as You (a) provide Parasoft prompt written notice of the claim; (b) provide Parasoft all reasonable assistance and information to enable Parasoft to perform its duties under this Section 6; (c) allow Parasoft sole control of the defense and all related settlement negotiations; and (d) have not compromised or settled such claim.

EXCEPT AS LIMITED BY APPLICABLE LAW AND EXCLUDING PARASOFT'S LIABILITY TO YOU UNDER SECTION 6 (INDEMNIFICATION), AND REGARDLESS OF THE BASIS FOR YOUR CLAIM, PARASOFT'S MAXIMUM LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE LIMITED TO THE LICENSE OR MAINTENANCE FEES PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE OR MAINTENANCE GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.

9.0 MAINTENANCE
9.1 Maintenance Period.  If You have purchased a perpetual license, You are required to purchase first year Maintenance with the Software, and the Maintenance period will commence upon the initial delivery of the Software and continue for a period of one year.  If You have purchased a term license, Maintenance during the term is included at no additional charge.  The Maintenance period, at Your option, may be renewed pursuant to subsequent orders.  Prior to such renewal, Parasoft may, upon ten (10) business days written notice, require You to provide a report on Your use and deployment of the Software.  Such report will be certified by an officer of Yours and will specify, with respect to Your Software:  (a) the type and amount of Licensed Capacity; (b) the version; and (c) the Parasoft license serial number.  Parasoft shall issue an annual renewal notice to You at least ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the then-current Maintenance period.  Maintenance fees will be based on the then-current list price and are subject to change without notice.  
9.2 Support Coordinators.  Maintenance will consist of support services provided by Parasoft to one designated support coordinator of Yours (and one backup coordinator) per Your location, by telephone, email, and website.  Support is available during normal business hours in the applicable location within the Territory, Monday through Friday, excluding nationally observed holidays.
9.3 Additional Licensed Capacity.  In the event that You purchases additional Licensed Capacity for the Software prior to the annual anniversary date of the Maintenance period, You agree to pay applicable Maintenance fees based on Parasoft's then-current Maintenance rates.  Maintenance fees will apply from the effective date of such additional Licensed Capacity and continue for a period of one year thereafter, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the parties, so that Maintenance for Your previously acquired Software and added Licensed Capacity is coterminous.
9.4 New Releases.  During any period in which You are current on Maintenance, Parasoft shall provide You with any new release of the Software, which may include generally available error corrections, modifications, maintenance patch releases, enhancements (unless priced separately by Parasoft and generally not included with new licenses for the Software at that time), and the revised User Documentation, if applicable.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, stand-alone error corrections that are not part of a new release will not be independently supported but will be incorporated into the next release of the Software.  If You install a new release of the Software, You may continue to use the previous version of the Software for up to ninety (90) days in order to assist You in the transition to the new release.  Once You complete its transition to the new release of the Software, You must discontinue use of the previous version of the Software. 
9.5 Supported Releases.  Parasoft shall continue to support the immediately preceding release of the Software for a period of twelve (12) months following the discontinuance of such Software or the date on which the new release becomes generally available, provided that You have paid applicable Maintenance fees and incorporated all Maintenance patch releases issued by Parasoft for the release of the Software.
9.6 Reinstatement of Maintenance.  If You allow Maintenance to expire, You may, at a later date, renew Maintenance by paying the following: (a) if You have installed the current release of the Software but have failed to pay the applicable renewal fee on or before the ninetieth (90th) day following expiration of the Maintenance period, annual Maintenance fees at Parasoft's then-current rates, plus Parasoft's then-current reinstatement fee; or (b) if You have not installed the current release of the Software or have failed to pay the applicable renewal fee by the ninetieth (90th) day following expiration of the Maintenance period, annual Maintenance fees at Parasoft's then-current rates, plus Parasoft's then-current license update fee for the current release of the Software.
